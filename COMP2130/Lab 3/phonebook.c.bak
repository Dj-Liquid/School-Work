//A phone book typically lists the name, address, and telephone number of everyone
//living in an area. Write code defining a structure template that could be used to store this
//data. Assume that a name and address will be no more than 30 characters each, and that a
//telephone number has exactly seven digits. Write code that will enter records in your
//structure. Write a function that will accept a pointer to a phone book structure and present all
//the records. Write a function that accepts a name and locate the record matching that name.
